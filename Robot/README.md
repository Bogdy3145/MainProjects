SIDE PROJECT

https://youtu.be/Ma4ArkK9BAE

This is a robot that I and two other friends built.

Used language: C

While learning how to build and program it, we learnt about the basics and a bit more of the STM-32 Nucleo microcontroller.

This robot has inside 2 of these microcontrollers. 

**What I did in this project:** 

-I set up the communication from the controller to the robot
 
Initially the communication was made through bluetooth. A simple mobile app was downloaded and it transfered data with the microcontroller throughout a bluetooth module.

-Because this was too easy, I changed to using the controller you see in the video.
        -This controller was officially made for flying drones and it communicates through RF.
    
-I took the input from the controller and gave it physical functionalities
    
-Gave power to the wheels based on the 2 joysticks (one for power like a gear-ratio and another one for speed)

-Using a ultra-sound distance sensor, I kept track of surrounding objects and made sure the robot wouldn't bump into anything

That's pretty much it, hope you like it! ;)
