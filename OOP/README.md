FMI // SEM 2

Used language: C++

Here are the first assignments I had to do in the OOP course.
Basically we were given one problem and throughout the semester we had to improve it.

If anybody will care to read, my assignment was Local Movie Database that is in the deeper READMEs.

VERY sadly, I lost like more than half of the assignments, so my proof of work stops at Assignment number 5 out of 11.
