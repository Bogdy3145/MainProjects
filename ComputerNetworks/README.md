Here I have this "tutorial" of me presenting how I set up a network consisting of a few sub-networks in Cisco, given some requirements.
Nothing too fancy, just a project we had to do for the Course.

The rest of the problems we had to do in this course were mostly programs (ran on different devices) that communicated through the network (TCP, UDP) and so on..
