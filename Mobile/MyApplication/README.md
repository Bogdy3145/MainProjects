FMI // Sem 5

My first ever mobile app, hours spent on this: prorbably < 20h

Used language: Kotlin in Android Studio.

(sadly I didn't use a frontend framework like Jetpack Composer or something, I did the entire frontend just in XML and it looks...... not great :) )
Still, pretty proud for it given the fact that it's just a homework.
